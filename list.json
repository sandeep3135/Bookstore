Hello everyone!
My name is Sandeep Kumar, and I’m really glad to introduce myself.
I’ve completed my Bachelor of Technology in computer science, and I’ve always been passionate about technology and development. Over time, that passion led me to become a Front-End Web Developer, where I love turning creative ideas into responsive and user-friendly websites.

I’ve worked on several 	projects that helped me strengthen my technical and problem-solving skills. Some of my favorite projects include a Bookstore Web App built using the MERN stack, a Blog Management System where users can create and manage posts dynamically, and a Cab Service Website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a smooth booking experience.

Along the way, I’ve also completed a certification in the Foundation of Web Development on Udemy, which gave me a deeper understanding of front-end development.

For the past few months, I’ve also been working as a freelancer, which has given me the opportunity to explore new skills and technologies, I always love to learn and explore new things,and continuously improve my skills as a developer.  
  Thank you.
